# v0.1

Migration to Jekyll started.

divided the website code by repetitive sections:
head, google analytics, header, portfolio-last-p, footer, js (javascript/JQuery links)

Using two layouts:
default - used for homepage and as main layout others are derived form
page - used for pages such as About, Contact, etc.


# TO DO:

make buttons as includes

move anchol link tags inside button tags
