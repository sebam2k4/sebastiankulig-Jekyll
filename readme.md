[www.sebastiankulig.com](http://www.sebastiankulig.com) is a personal website and portfolio of my web design and development projects. It is being developed using Jekyll and deployed using [Surge.sh](www.surge.sh)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by a web server.

## Development Instructions

To set up your environment to develop this website:
1. Clone this repo
2. run `bundle install` from the root folder of the repo (where _config.yml file is).

To test the website locally as you make changes to it:
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the root folder of the repo and open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/`. 

This starts a Jekyll server using the website's files and contents. Refresh your browser as modifications are made to see any changes.

For more information about Jekyll and how it works, check out [Jekyll's Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/)

## Notes
1. Please feel free to fork/clone to play around with the code or develop your own project.
2. This project will most likely develop into a full Jekyll theme in the future for anyone to use.
3. Please don't use any of my content: text and pictures.
