# v0.1

Migration to Jekyll started.

divided the website code by repetitive sections:
head, google analytics, header, portfolio-last-p, footer, js (javascript/JQuery links)

Using two layouts:
default - used for homepage and as main layout others are derived form
page - used for pages such as About, Contact, etc.

Basic _config.yml configuration completed


# TO DO:

Change all .html pages to .md and move as much html to _layouts

Add Web Development courses' progress from my [Repo](https://github.com/sebam2k4/Web-Development-Curriculum)

Add this page to portfolio

Update some site content

Research a deployment method. Github Pages is limiting. How to easily deploy to current hosting?

finish content for portfolio pages

set up better includes and work on getting this look more like a Jekyll Theme with front-matter

make buttons as includes

move anchor link tags inside button tags - html validation

look at liquid

look at Jekyll Documentation

how to intergate this with github and push updates to external host: register365
