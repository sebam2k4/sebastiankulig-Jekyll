# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

Hello there good sir!

This is my first blog post on my personal portfolio-slash-semi-professional website.

I'm going to talk about coding, my journey into full-stack web development, and other things that interest me such as realtime 3D architectural vizualizations and memes.

Hope you stay a while and visit often.

Code Block Sample using liquid and rogue highlighting:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Blockquote Sample (rather underwhelming atm):

> "Hello"

<div class="note">
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>This is a sample note... Can't find a way to make these notes in pure markdown... :&#41;</p>
</div>

Definition Lists (desperately need styling):

HTML
:  HyperText Markup Language

Definition Lists with `<p>` elements:

CSS

:  Cascading Style Sheets used to style a website.

:  Documents structured using XML or HTML are able to make use of them.

Abbreviations Sample:

Markdown converts text to HTML.

*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
