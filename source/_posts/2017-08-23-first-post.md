Hello there good sir!

This is my first blog post on my personal portfolio-slash-semi-professional website.

I'm going to talk about coding, my journey into full-stack web development, and other things that interest me such as realtime 3D architectural vizualizations and memes.

Hope you stay a while and visit often.

Code Sample:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
